KNOWN BUGS
----------

*  Sorting bug in example2.shtml ("command" column).

*  Internet Explorer Filter Form Loses Focus After Submit.

*  Gracefully handle non-numeric when numeric sorting.               
   Sorting seems to stop when a column is configured for
   numeric sort, but sort function encounters a non-number...

*  Does not work in Opera 6.02. Has not been tested in later 
   Opera versions.

   If columns[].style.defineRule() regex is blank, then error:

   Detect when regex is blank and set regex to /^$/.

*  Hyphenation only works on first long string(?)
