# For optimal performance, you should set Apache's DocumentRoot to be the www directory
# in httpd.conf, or apache2.conf.  For example:
#
# <VirtualHost example.com>
#   ServerName example.com
#   DocumentRoot /home/mylogin/freebeer/www
#   ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
# </VirtualHost>

# If you are unable to do this, then assuming the mod_rewrite module is available,
# the following rewrite rules will redirect all requests to the /www directory:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine on
#	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.*)
#	RewriteRule !^www /www%1 [L,QSA] 
</IfModule>

# If mod_rewrite isn't available, then you will need to 
# rename index.php.redirect to index.php.
#
# Note: using this last solution, all links in the website will need to be 
# relative links. Absolute links will *not* work, using this solution.

# Leave the following line so /bin/update_htaccess.php doesn't add a "Deny from all"
Allow from all

# Deny access to all CVS related files
<FilesMatch "^(\.cvsignore|.cvswrappers|CVS)$">
	Deny from all
</FilesMatch>
