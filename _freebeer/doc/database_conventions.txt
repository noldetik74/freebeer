*	For portability, table/field names should be lower case. 
	
	This allows us to use Postgres more easily, as it requires quotes
	around names with mixed case names.

*	For portability, table/field names should be 31 characters
	or less in length.
	
	In fact, the combined length of a table name, and an included 
	field name should not exceed 27 characters.
	This allow us to name our related objects as
	i_tablename_fieldname (index), 
	s_tablename_fieldname (sequence)
	c_tablename_fieldname (constraint), etc.

*	For readability, table/field names should use a '_' character between 
	words.

	For example, use order_item, not orderitem.

*	For consistency, table names should be plural, and 
	field names should be singular.

	For example, use order_items, not order_item.

*	For portability, avoid naming tables/fields that are potential
	reserved words (see reserved_words.txt list for a complete list).

	To avoid using a potential reserved word, you may break rule 4.
	For example, use orders instead of order for a field name.

*	For consistency, identity fields should be named tablename_id.

	For example, use cust_id for the identity field in the cust table.

*	For consistency, foreign key fields should be named the same as 
	the foreign key the field is related to.

*	For portability, avoid using database specific features.

	For example, in MySQL, avoid using ENUM and SET fields, the
	UNSIGNED, and ZEROFILL attributes, and other MySQL specific
	constructs.

*	In queries, prepend a '~' to each tablename.

	For example, refer to the cust table as ~cust.

	This allows us to define a unique prefix for each table name,
	to allow for installation on shared servers.

*	Define a short unique alias for each table.  The alias should be
	the first letter of each word in a table name.
	
	For example:
	
	customers c
	orders o
	order_items oi
	
	If two tables start with the same letter, add an additional 
	letter to the less commonly used table.  For example:
	
	customers c
	customer_address ca

*	Always use this alias for each table used in multi table queries.

	For example:
	
	SELECT
		c.cust_id,
		o.order_date 
	FROM
		~cust   c,
		~orders o
	WHERE
		c.cust_id = o.cust_id
	ORDER BY
		c.name
