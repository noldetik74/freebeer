=--- Chora Installation Guide ---------------------------- INSTALL --=
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you install Chora, make sure that you have the Horde libraries
correctly installed.

System Requirements:

 o PHP-4.1.0+ (http://www.php.net)
 o Horde libraries (http://horde.org)
 o RCS and CVS binaries on the system (http://www.cvshome.org)
 o CVSROOT directory (either local or NFS).  A CVS checkout will
   not do - you need to have the full repository available!

After that, installation of Chora is pretty simple.

- In the config/ directory, make copies of all of the configuration
  "dist" files without the "dist" suffix:

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

- Edit each of these configuration files, following the comments
  beside each value.

- Go to the Chora URL, and test out all the functionality to
  ensure it is working.

If you run into a problem with annotations, it is because some
versions of CVS insist on having the CVSROOT/history file as
world-writable.  Either make this file world-writable, or simply
delete it (you don't need to have it for CVS to work).

If you have any further questions, look at http://horde.org/mail/
for details on the Chora mailing lists and archives.

Have fun!
