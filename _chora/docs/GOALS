A very rough roadmap for future Chora features.

------
 1.1+
------

o External pretty-print support via GNU enscript and other utilities.

o Other utility support (lint support for C files, pod2html for perl,
  PHPDoc for PHP)

o Provide compressed versions of files/directories on a given tag,
  for downloading (might wait till version 2.x).

o Intelligent diff based on MIME type.  For example, if it is an image,
  then show the old and new version side-by-side.  Investigate engines
  other than plain-old-diff to see if they can do a better job.

------
 2.0+
------

o Provide a database and caching backend for advanced searching.

o Generate per-directory and per-repository visual branch views,
  instead of only per-file.

o Assign Commit IDs, and view all the changes in a given commit,
  instead of a given file.

o Integration with Subversion / Perforce and other revision
  control systems.
