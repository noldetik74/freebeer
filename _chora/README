      the documentation in the Horde distribution.

All Chora documentation is located in the docs/ subdirectory.  Start by
reading the docs/INSTALL file.


Need Help?
----------

If you run into problems during the installation, there are multiple
resources as your disposal. It is highly suggested that you consult them
in this order:

    1)  The Chora documentation (located in the docs/ subdirectory).
    2)  The mailing lists. More information at http://horde.org/mail/.

Failing to read the documentation before asking a simple question answered
therein will no doubt result in a less-than-welcome response from the mailing
lists. You've been warned. =)
