$Horde: horde/docs/RELEASE,v 1.18 2004/03/06 17:15:20 jan Exp $


The steps to use when cutting a new release:

-   Examine */docs/CHANGES files:

    --  Add the word SECURITY in front of any security-related changes,
        and move them to the top, to draw attention to them.

    --  Cull out the most important ones, and prepare the text of an
        announcement.

    --  Write the release announcements into the docs/RELEASE_NOTES file and
        check if it parses with `php -l docs/RELEASE_NOTES'.

-   Examine */README and docs/* files, and update the version if necessary.

-   Make sure your settings in horde/scripts/make-release-conf.php are
    correct.

-   if you want to use another CVSROOT than the default one, set the CVSROOT
    environment variable to a user with commit privs
    (e.g. user@cvs.horde.org:/repository) and change to an empty directory.

-   Create the tarballs/patches using (HEAD) horde/scripts/make-release.php:

    --  Must be run as root (to set file ownership).

    --  Can optionally add "--nocommit --noftp --noannounce" to do a "dry run"
        that will not make any CVS and FTP changes or announcements.

    --  Example commands (omit "--branch" when building HEAD):

        # make-release.php --module=horde --version=2.<n> --branch=RELENG_2
        # make-release.php --module=imp --version=3.<n> --branch=RELENG_3
        # make-release.php --module=turba --version=1.<n> --branch=RELENG_1

-   Update the web site (hordeweb CVS directory):

    --  Edit top-level hordeweb/main.html

    --  For Horde, under hordeweb/horde edit:

        horde.html

    --  For IMP, under hordeweb/imp edit:

        3.0/2002 (or current year) 3.0/latest.html 3.0/supported.html
        download/download.html

    --  For Turba, under hordeweb/turba edit:

        content.txt download/download.html

    --  If applicable, under hordeweb/source edit:

        versions.html


** Guidelines for release candidates (RCs):

* The last time we introduced a bug with code from a new minor release so
we had to release another version right after. This might always happen if
there is more than one change since the last release or if the changes were
done recently.

* If we have a security leak that needs to be plugged immediately, it is
the common way to release a new minor version that *only* contains the fix
for that leak.

* RCs are necessary for every release (except 3) because many translators
only update their translations when there is a new (minor) release cycle
starting because they don't translate on CVS versions.


** Example format for announcement messages:

The Horde Team is pleased to announce the (first release candidate|official
release) of the [MODULE NAME] version [VERSION].
