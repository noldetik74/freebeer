HORDE: How to Help
------------------

There are many ways in which you can help out in the development of any of
the Horde projects. The first and best way you are already doing: you're
using them. One of the keys to a great product is its users. Without users
we can't find bugs or get feedback on what's good and what's bad.

There are also certain areas that the development lacks in. Support for
operating systems other than Linux are secondary. Most of the developers
currently primarily use Linux (not saying all). Recently we've had more luck
with testing on other platforms. This is mainly directed towards the Windows
platform as Windows and Linux can act completely different (and Netscape and
Internet Explorer even more so).

With this said, one of the best ways you can help is to test. If you can
help us smooth out the code across all (or even any) platforms, you're doing
a great service to the project.

Now, if that's not enough and you want to dig in and help code, you should
first subscribe to the project lists and read the Coding Standards (see the
Horde README file, and the file CODING_STANDARDS in this directory).

Please send any comments or questions pertaining to this document to
