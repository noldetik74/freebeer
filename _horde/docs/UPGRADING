Upgrading to Horde 3.0
======================

This is a non-exhaustive, quick explanation of what has changed between
an Horde 2.x installation to Horde 3.0.

* Configuration files
Most configuration files have been changed to XML format. To generate a valid
configuration file from the XML file, follow the configuration instructions
in the applications' docs/INSTALL file.

* Preferences
The last_login preference has changed its format and scope. Just remove all
last_login preferences from the preferences backend.
