What is Horde?
--------------

The Horde Project is a group of developers who write Web applications
using the Horde Application Framework, itself a product of the
Project.

The Horde Application Framework is written in PHP, and provides the
common tools a Web application requires: classes for dealing with
preferences, compression, browser detection, connection tracking,
MIME, and more.

The Horde Framework, by itself, does not provide any significant end
user functionality; it provides a base for other applications and
tools for developers. You will probably want to install some of the
available Horde applications, such as IMP (a webmail client), or
Kronolith (a calendar). There is a list of Horde applications and
projects at http://www.horde.org/projects.php.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.
OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.
